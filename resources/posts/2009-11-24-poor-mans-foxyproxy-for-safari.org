#+title: Poor Man's Foxyproxy for Safari
#+tags: apple bash ssh

Safari is a lot faster than Firefox on Mac OS X, I have been thinking
about switching to Safari but not having a Foxyproxy equivalent was a
big problem.

Fortunately Apple does provide a command to set/enable/disable proxy
settings. Following script implements a poor man's version of Foxyproxy
when you run it, it will setup a SSH SOCKS proxy to the server and
enable proxy settings for safari, when killed with Ctrl-C, it will kill
the SSH connection and disable proxy settings.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/bash
  
  DEVICE="Airport"
  HOST="127.0.0.1"
  PORT="9999"
  
  
  echo "[+] Connecting"
  ssh -ND $PORT user@server.com &
  FIND_PID=$!
  sleep 5
  
  echo "[+] Enabling Proxy"
  sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy $DEVICE $HOST $PORT off
  
  function quit {
      echo "[+] Disabling Proxy"
      sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $DEVICE off
      kill -9 $FIND_PID
      exit
  }
  
  trap "quit" SIGINT SIGTERM
  
  while :
  do
      sleep 60
  done
#+END_SRC

Save it somewhere on your machine, and make it executable.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  chmod 755 foxy-proxy.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you are ready to defeat that evil proxy.
